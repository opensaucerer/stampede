# stampede

A simple tool to interactively stamp PDF files

## Running

Although this project contains HTML and CSS, the logic is written in Typescript and will require the following dependencies for successful building and running.

- nodejs
- npm

Once you have the above installed, you can follow the steps below.

- Install the npm dependencies. This is literally just the Typescript compiler

```bash
npm install
```

- Lauch a local server to see the interactive UI

```bash
npm start
```

- You can also build the Typescript files separately, if you wish

```bash
npm build
```

- Then lauch a local server to see the interactive UI

```bash
npm serve
```
